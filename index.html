    <p>A map made from data downloaded from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) Arms Transfers Database of Trend Indicator Values (TIV). These values are based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and are intended
      to allow for a common measurement of arms flow trends between nations over time. This map plots trends in arms transfers from the US to other nations between 1950 and 2023.</p>

    <h3>Women Scientists in Pre-War Tokyo</h3>
    <p>This project is an attempt to undo the erasure of women scientists and affirm their contributions to science in early twentieth-century Japan. Although the government was not active in promoting women/'s higher education and training women scientists, ambitious women and their supporters created spaces where women could engage in scientific inquiry. By mapping these sites and naming the women scientists associated with them, this project demonstrates that women were part of the development of modern science in Japan. This was a collaboration with Lisa Nakahara.</p>

    <p>This map helps users locate Iowa counties impacted by planned carbon pipeline construction, ordinances, litigation, and news. Research for this project was conducting by staff and research assistants of the Hubbell Environmental Law Initiative at the University of Iowa College of law. This application was developed by the University of Iowa Libraries' Digital Scholarship & Publishing Studio.

    <h3>Tour Mid-Twentieth Century Iowa Green Books</h3>
    <p>Victor Hugo Green, a New York postal employee, founded the Negro Motorist Green Book in 1936 and published it annually for 30 years. The publication was an indispensable tool for Black motorists in the U.S., who navigated through a segregated nation during the Jim Crow era. The guide included information about restaurants, lodging, and other services considered hospitable to Black travelers. Establishments in Iowa were among those listed in the Green Book, identified in the linked interactive map. This was a collaboration with David McCartney.</p>
